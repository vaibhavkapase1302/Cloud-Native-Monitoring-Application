This repository contains the application code for cloud-native-monitoring-application. 
It follows the best practice of GitOps by separating the application code from the manifest repository.

## manifest-repo

The manifest files for deploying and managing the application can be found in the [manifest-repo](https://github.com/Anup-Narkhede/manifest-repo). 
This repository holds the declarative configuration files (manifests) used to deploy and manage the application in a Kubernetes using CD tool ArgoCD.
